# Coursework 2: Neural Networks 

This coursework covers the topics covered in class regarding neural networks for image classification.

This coursework includes both coding questions as well as written ones. Please upload the notebook, which contains your code, results and answers as a pdf file onto Cate.

Dependencies: If you work on a college computer in the Computing Lab, where Ubuntu 18.04 is installed by default, you can use the following virtual environment for your work, where relevant Python packages are already installed.

`source /vol/bitbucket/wbai/virt/computer_vision_ubuntu18.04/bin/activate`

Alternatively, you can use pip, pip3 or anaconda etc to install Python packages.

**Note 1:** please read the both the text and code comment in this notebook to get an idea what you are supposed to implement.

**Note 2:** If you are using the virtual environment in the Computing Lab, please run the following command in the command line before opening jupyter-notebook and importing tensorflow. This will tell tensorflow where the Nvidia CUDA libaries are.

`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/vol/cuda/9.0.176/lib64/:"${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}"`
